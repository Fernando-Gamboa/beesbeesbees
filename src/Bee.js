// Set the Prototype and Constructor -----
// this sets up the prototype relationship between the Subclass instantiation and the original Class (Grub).
Bee.prototype = Object.create(Grub.prototype);
// since the previous line overwrote our prototype constructor, we must setup our Subclass relationship to its Constructor prototype object.
